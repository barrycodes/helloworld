# helloworld
The usual

This is my 'hello world' project to get started on github.

I'm Barry and have been programming computers for 20 years (since age 12).

Most of my experience is with desktop development in C# on the .NET platform. My more recent experience is with web programming. Currently I'm pursuing an MCSD / Web Programming certification.

Some of the major projects I've worked on professionally are labor tracking and reporting software and video surveillance software.

Right now I'm refreshing my github skills!
